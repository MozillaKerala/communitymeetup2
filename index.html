          <h2>The Meetup 2.0</h2>
          <p>We had the first Mozilla Kerala Meetup in September 2013
              (<a href="http://blog.mozillakerala.org/2013/11/meetup1/" title="Read about Mozilla Kerala Meetup 1.0">Meetup 1.0</a>).
              18 passionate Mozillians from across Kerala attended the event. 18 strangers with a common dream - a better Web.
              We talked, inspired and got inspired. By the end of the day, the strangers were gone and a community was born.
              It has been a wonderful time for us - the community - since then. We did a lot of things,
              organized several events and took part in lots of activities. We taught little kids to code;
              we taught senior citizens how to use Internet safely;
              we introduced Firefox OS to developers; and what not!
          </p>

          <p>
              So the time has come again for us to meet as a community, reflect on our activities since the last meetup
              and plan for the future. Our community has grown a lot more since the last meetup. More buzz is going on around and
              people have joined the community since then. In 2014, we have a lot more ground to cover and lot more people to reach.
              We have to build the Web that the world deserve and make sure everyone has equal opportunity to use and take part
              in building the Web. A web that is open for all, but still private for each.
          </p>

            <h3>Sounds interesting?</h3>
            <p>
                Then make sure you read and understand the <a class="link_slide" href="#faq">FAQ</a> section given below very carefully.
                And if you still believe you want to become a part of Mozilla Kerala, go ahead and <a class="link_slide" href="#register">Register</a>.

     	<h2>About Mozilla Kerala</h2>
          <ul>
	
            <li>
                <p><strong>Our mission is to promote openness, innovation & opportunity on the Web.</strong> - Mozilla</p>
                <p>
                    The Mozilla Kerala community is part of the global
                    <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/contact/communities/kerala/" title="Find Mozilla Kerala in mozilla.org"> Mozilla community</a>,
                    primarily aimed at spreading the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/mission/" title ="Mozilla's Mission">mission of Mozilla</a> in Kerala.
                    If you haven't guessed already, most of us here are hard core Mozilla nuts ☺ But like all geeks, we care about other stuff too :-)
                </p>
                <p>
                    What unifies us as a community is that, all of us want to use technology for something good. Doing good is part of our code, duh.
                </p>

                       Please read the <u>Note</u> given below and decide if this is fit for you. If in doubt, mail to <abbr class="mozk-email-obfuscated">events[at]mozillakerala[dot]org</abbr> or
                       call us at one of the phone numbers given below :-)</p>

			<p><strong>Note: </strong>This event is invite only and is aimed at laying the foundation of Mozilla community in Kerala.
                So this meetup is aimed at those who love Mozilla and wish to be active volunteers in our who can take
                up responsibilities. We all have other important things in life, such as school, college, work etc.
                So we are not expecting anyone to put off any such other things and work for the community.
                Its more like, you have to have a strong passion for Mozilla and the values for which
                we stand for and should be willing to give it your best possible.</p>

			<p>So if you are not a hard core Mozilla fan (or a wannabe hard core Mozillian), you might not want to attend this meeting. You can still participate in other public Mozilla events we organize, including but not limited to the upcoming developer events.</p>
